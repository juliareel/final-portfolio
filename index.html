                <div id="aboutPara">
                    <p>Hello! My name is Julia, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at the 
                        University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Information 
                        (BSI) degree. I am studying at the School of Information with a concentration on 
                        Information Analysis. 
                    </p>
        
                    <p>I am a highly analytical individual who loves finding patterns and connecting the dots 
                        within seas of information. I am passionate about using technology and data to gather 
                        insights and develop solutions to today's complex problems. Throughout my studies at the 
                        University of Michigan, I have acquired numerous skills in a range of technologies including 
                        Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and R. This upcoming summer, in 2022, I am excited to join Anthem Inc. Insurance
                        as a Data Analytics Intern in the Pharmacy Operations department. I look forward to the opportunity
                        to learn and develop my skills in data analytics in a professional environment.

                        <p>I grew up in Madison, Connecticut where I attended Daniel Hand High School.
                            I graduated in June, 2019 with an unweighted GPA of 3.9/4.0.
                            Throughout my time in high school, I was very involved in my community and 
                            spent my afternoons tutoring young students in nearby New Haven, CT. I also
                            co-directed and individually led local blood drives with the American Red Cross, 
                            organizing drives both within DHHS and off campus.

                        <p> In September, 2019, I began my studies in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan.
                            Earlier this year, in 2021, I was admitted to the university's upper-level program within
                            the School of Information where I currently study Information Analysis. I expect to 
                            graduate with my Bachelor of Science in 2023. Outside of the classroom, I participate in  
                            Dance Marathon at UM, and I am a member of our campus's Girls Who Code club. I am also very 
                            involved in my sorority on campus, Delta Delta Delta.
